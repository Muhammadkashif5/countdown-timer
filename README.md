The COUNTDOWN TIMER Node.js project enables users to input a desired duration in seconds, initiating the timer to count down. If invalid inputs like alphabets or negative numbers are entered, appropriate error messages are displayed. Additionally, if the entered duration exceeds 60 seconds, a message prompts the user to input a number less than or equal to 60. Once the specified time elapses, the timer stops automatically.
